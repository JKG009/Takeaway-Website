# Takeaway Website

A basic takeaway website and associated menu I designed for a Chinese Takeaway I worked at.

### Disclaimer

While the Golden Wok is a real shop, this website is only a personal project and should not be used as its information can be out-dated and photos and description seen on the webpage does not reflect the Golden Wok's true products.

### Project Description

Project was made with HTML, CSS and Javascript. Utilizing React, React-Router-Dom and styled-components.

### How to run

This project was made using create-react-app. You will need to run it on your localhost using npm start.

### Misc Information

Whilst I was working at the takeaway I recieved countless questions, one which was always asked was "do you have a website I can see the menu from?". Tired from answer the question I took this opportunity to work on my front-end web development skill and decided to design a website for the store.  

My plan was to use some fake photos as a template for my design before replacing them with real photos that I will take from the store before launching the website. I also planned on learning and setting a up server where customers can order online on the website (as the store was not on any food ordering platform like JustEat) as this was also a common request.  

Unfortunately, the owner does not wish for an online presence as he believed it would cause more problems than benefit. Therefore I did not proceed as planned as I wanted to proceed to learn React-Redux and the Google Maps API will state an error as I never enabled billing for its use.
